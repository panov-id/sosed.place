#   BUNNY_STORAGE_API_KEY    Storage Zone password
#   RELAY_API_URL            relay backend base for this environment (waitlist + client-error)

# for each inline script, style block and style attribute, so a hand-kept list
# would go stale on the first markup edit; computing it here it cannot.
#
# The failure mode this guards against is specific: the header lives at the edge,
# a local server never sends it, so a wrong hash is a blank page in production and
# nowhere else. That is why this runs inside the deploy and not beside it.
# A way out when the builder itself is wrong. Rolling back by code fixes a policy
# that is wrong for these bytes; it does nothing when every version computes the
# same broken policy, and the page is then blank in production and fine
# everywhere else. SKIP_SECURITY_HEADERS=1 ships the files and purges without
# touching the rule; deploy/apply-edge-headers.py --remove (in xor.ad) takes an
